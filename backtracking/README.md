Backtracking is an extremely common alogrithm/skill used in various interview questions. I've been asked many backtracking questions in real interivews (Google onsite -- number blocks). Backtracking is used when we need to cover all possible cases (no Dynamic Programming here) and we know that we can exit out early of a recursion if the path isn't correct. Essentially, backtracking is a DFS algorithm without early termination. Note that when we come out of a recursive call, we need to "undo" what we did for that DFS branch (usually removing the last element from a List). 

Take a look at [this amazing Leetcode discuss post about backgracking](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/discuss/16502/A-general-approach-to-backtracking-questions-in-Java-(Subsets-Permutations-Combination-Sum-Palindrome-Partitioning)).
