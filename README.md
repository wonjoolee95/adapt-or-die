# interview-questions

This is a collection of technical interview questions (aka Leetcode). For each of these questions, I try my best to explain my thought process and approach to the problem, rather than just giving the solution. I also explain the runtime and space complexity for my solution.

The questions are categorized according to data structure. I have included my own tips to approach problems of the similar type in the README of each category.

All the best!
