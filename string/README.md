Questions that involve strings are extremely common in interviews. One very common algorithm that can be applied to many string-related questions is sliding window. In a sliding window algorithm, we have left and right pointers. The right pointer continues to advance until a condition is met. And while this condition is still being met, we gradually decrease the left pointer. Then we can find the shortest substring that meets the condition. 

An important part in using the sliding window algorithm is how we define the condition. We need a quick way to determine if the condition is being met or not. A common approach is to use a count to represent the condition. If the condition is the bigger string containing all the small string, we can have a map that stores frequency of the smaller string. Then every time when see a character with the right pointer, we can subtract the count variable if the right character is in the frequency map and has a value of >= 0 (think about why this is the case -- we don't want to keep subtracting the count variable if we repeatedly see the same character.

Take a look at these questions and their explanation to see how we use our sliding window algorithm in real questions:
