An extremely common pattern in array problems is sliding window. There are two flavors in sliding window. First one is the classic two-pointer sliding window, where we have a start and end pointer with the end pointer continuously increasing until we hit a condition and decrement the start pointer. An example of such problem is solved here -- https://github.com/wonjoolee95/adapt-or-die/blob/master/array/MinSubArrayLen.java. A constraint to using this method is that the subarray has to strictly increase -- in other words, the array must only contain positive integers. Think about why this is the case -- it is because if it were to contain negative integers, we don't know, at any point i, if the subarray will become greater or not. Therefore, we cannot have this start/end pointer algorithm. This is where the second type of sliding window algorithm comes in. The second one is where we maintain a hashmap with the subarray sum mapped to its index. We continuously add the i-th element to the currSum while looking to see if subtracting a subarray sum that we've seen before can equal to the target.
